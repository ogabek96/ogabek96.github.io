Because when demand is higher than supply, energy prices get higher. You can help by reducing your energy consumption during peak times, so the National Grid can provide a reliable and potentially cheaper electricity supply throughout the upcoming colder months.\\n<br>\\nBy doing this, we can also avoid the National Grid generating electricity from non-renewable sources that create more co2 emissions. Don’t worry, we always make sure all the electricity we provide to you on our fixed tariffs is backed by renewable sources.*\\n<br>\\nIf we all make small energy shifts to our consumption we can make energy better together. That’s why we’re teaming up with the National Grid on a series of energy saving events throughout peak times, usually between 4pm and 7pm, from November until March. And we want you to join us.\\n<br>\\nFor each event, which lasts from one to four hours, you’ll be set an energy reduction target based on your typical consumption.
